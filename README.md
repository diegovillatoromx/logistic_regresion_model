# Building a logistic regresion model with python

# Business Objective
Predicting a qualitative response for observation can be referred to as classifying that
observation since it involves assigning the observation to a category or class.
Classification forms the basis for Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression is a
supervised algorithm used to predict a dependent variable that is categorical or
discrete. Logistic regression models the data using the sigmoid function.
Churned Customers are those who have decided to end their relationship with their
existing company. In our case study, we will be working on a churn dataset.
XYZ is a service-providing company that provides customers with a one-year
subscription plan for their product. The company wants to know if the customers will
renew the subscription for the coming year or not.
